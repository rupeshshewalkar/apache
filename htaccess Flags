#RewriteRule Flags and examples

RewriteEngine On

#[B] - Causes the RewriteRule to escape non-alphanumeric characters prior to the rewrite transformation.
RewriteRule ^models/data/(.*)$ /data/list.php?value=$1 [B]

#[R] - Causes the Apache server to issue a 302 Redirect back to the client. This will show the redirect URL in the client browser.
#[L] - Tells mod_rewrite that this is the last rule and disregard any following rules.
RewriteRule ^models/(.*)$ http://myboats.com/models/${lc:$1}.html [R,L]

#[C] - Chain causes mod_rewrite to build multiple rules together where the output of one rule becomes the input of the next.
RewriteRule ^models/list/(.*)$ http://myboats.com/models/data/list/$1 [C]
RewriteRule ^models/data/list/(.*?)\.html$ http://myboats.com/models/data/list/$1.php

#Cookie: CO=Name:Value:Domain[:Lifetime[:Path]]
[CO=logout:yes:myboats.com:30] - Causes Apache to set a cookie when visiting the domain
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [CO=logout:yes:myboats.com:30]

#[DPI]Discard path information attached to a value so only the value is used
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /images/$1 [DPI]

#[E]Set an environment variable. Here we are writing to the access log for requests other then jpg or png images
[E=VAR:VAL] or [E=!VAR]
RewriteRule \.(jpg|png)$ - [E=log:1]
CustomLog logs/access combined env=!log

#[END] Works like [L] but prevents subsequent htaccess parsing
RewriteRule ^models/data/list/(.*?)\.html$ http://myboats.com/models/data/list/$1.php [END]

#[F] Causes Apache to send a 403 Forbidden status code
RewriteRule ^admin$ -[F]

#[G] Causes Apache to send a 410 Gone status
RewriteRule ^models/tide.html$ - [G,NC]

#[H] Causes Apache to specify a handler for certain file extensions
RewriteRule !\.php$ - [H=application/x-httpd-php]

#[N] Causes Apache to start again from the first rule. Functions like a while loop.
RewriteRule (.*)/images/(.*) $1/graphics/$2 [N] #This would cause replacements for "images" as long as they are found in the url

#[NC] Causes Apache to ignore case
RewriteRule ^models/(.*?)\.html$ http://myboats/models/$1.php [NC]

#[NE] Causes Apache to not escape special characters like & or ?
RewriteRule ^models/(.*)$ http://myboats/models/$1 [NE]

#[PT] Causes Apache to treat the RewriteRule substitution string as a URI instead of a file path (which is the default). The [PT] flag will cause the RewriteRule to recognize the alias used in the substitution string.
Alias /buttons /var/www/myboats/buttons
RewriteRule ^models/images/(.+)\.png$ buttons/$1.gif [PT]

#[QSA] Causes Apache to retain a query string if appended to the URL
RewriteRule ^models/data/(.+) /list/list.php?item=$1 [QSA]

#[QSD] Causes Apache to discard the query string if appended to the URL
RewriteRule ^models/data/.+ /list/list.php [QSD]

#[R] Causes Apache to redirect the browser.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://myboats.com [R]

#[C] Causes Apache to skip rules, most commonly used conditionally
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f # If so, skip the two following RewriteRules
RewriteRule .? - [S=2]
RewriteRule (.*\.gif) images.php?$1 # Skipped
RewriteRule (.*\.html) docs.php?$1 # Skipped

#[T] Causes Apache to set a MIME type for the response
RewriteRule \.pdf$ - [T=application/pdf]
